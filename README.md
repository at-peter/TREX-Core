# TREX-Core: Peter's Open AI gym development fork
**TREX is a simulation framework for developing Transactive Energy systems**
Unlike optimal powerflow-based approaches, TREX uses agent-based computational economics (ACE) principles to simulate real multi-agent interactions in a realistic market.

This repository contains the core components to get started. In addition to the core componants, this repository will also contain the development of the open AI gym and open AI baselines integration with TREX-Core.
